## Generative design- Laptop stand

In order to create a laptop stand which can withstand significant force, I began creating many models using generative design. 


Generative design is an AI-driven approach that uses algorithms to explore and produce innovative design solutions, optimizing for specific criteria. The criteria includes materials, manufacturing techniques, the magnitude and direction of a force acting on the object, the set objectives and more. 

When creating designs, the AI was given the objective to minimise the quantity of material used while maintining adequate structural integrity. The weight of the laptop was also applied on each design in the form of Newtons(N).
